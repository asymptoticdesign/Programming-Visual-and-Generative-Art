Description:
This class will be an overview of Processing, an open source programming language meant for creating interactive visual art.  Processing combines programming and creative expression, making it appealing to both the creatively and technically inclined.  This course will start from the basics of processing (static 2d drawing)  and slowly add features until we have interactive, animated pieces of art!  The rough outline of the course is:
 
Class 1: Control Flow and 2D Drawing in Processing
Class 2: Generative Art; Animating your Work
Class 3: Object-Oriented Programming
Class 4: User and Sound Interaction
 
Each session will focus around one or two short, guided projects to provide examples. 
Class Goals:
-learn basic syntax of Processing/Java 
-expose students to the capabilities of Processing
-give students confidence to approach their own Processing projects
Prerequisites:
None, though experience with basic programming (exposure to control flow like 'if', 'while', and 'for' loops) will ensure that you get the most out of the course.  Please have processing already installed on your personal computer (http://www.processing.org/download/) if you're not planning on using a computer from our computer lab.
